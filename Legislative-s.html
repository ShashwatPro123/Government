                Role of Government
            </h2>
            <h3>
                The state governments responsibility is to agree to the rules that the central government makes and make the same rules in their state also like a group in which some are working at central level some are working at state and some are working at local level.

                Influences of the Government on citizens life
            </h2>
            <h3>
                If the state government takes a good move then the people's lives become easier like if they clean the public places then it's easy for us to go there and if the state governments takes a bad move then the people's live become harder like their are some things that are important to do and there are some which are not really important to do.
